# My first Dev Landing Page

__Hi, I'm Antoine Jessen, and I'm learning how to code !__

I'm doing this landing page to learn Markdown, HTML and CSS. I'm using a template right now, but I would like to personnalize it later.

## Why?

Developers don't talk much. Their code does all the talking. So here's a minimal landing page for developers.

This project contain my web dev landing page. You will find my links of different social media and portfolio.

## Language to use

* HTML
* CSS
