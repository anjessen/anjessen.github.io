# Dev Landing Page

Minimal landing page for developers.

Developers don't talk much. Their code does all the talking. So here's a minimal landing page for developers.

## Why?

This project contain my web dev landing page. You will find my links of different social media and portfolio.

## Language to use

* HTML
* CSS

## How I create this page

* Create a new repo with the name `{username}.github.io`
* Clone/Fork this repo and copy the files to your newly created repo
* Customize your name, links and everything else for your landing page
* `git push`

Voila! Your site should be live at `https://{username}.github.io`

Here's my **Dev Landing Page** - [Antoine Jessen - portfolio](https://anjessen.github.io)
